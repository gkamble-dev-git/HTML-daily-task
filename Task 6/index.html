        <h2><center>VS CODE</center></h2>
        <p>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source, and powerful code editor developed by Microsoft. It is designed for software development and supports various programming languages and tools. Below are some key features and aspects of VS Code</p>
        <h2><center>VS CODE FEATURES</center></h2>
        <p><b>1.IntelliSense (Code Autocompletion):</b> VS Code provides smart code completion, method suggestions, and variable names based on the language you're working with, which helps you write code faster and avoid errors.</p>
        <p><b>2. Integrated Terminal:</b> The integrated terminal allows you to run shell commands directly within VS Code, making it easier to interact with your system without switching between windows.</p>
        <P><b>3. Debugger:</b> VS Code comes with a built-in debugger for various programming languages. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, step through code, and troubleshoot more effectively.</P>
        <p><b>4. Version Control (Git):</b> VS Code integrates with Git, allowing you to perform version control tasks like committing, pushing, pulling, and managing branches without leaving the editor.</p>
        <p><b>5. Extensions Marketplace:</b> The extensive library of extensions allows you to add support for different programming languages, themes, debuggers, linters, and tools directly in the editor. Some popular extensions include Python, Prettier, ESLint, and Docker.</p>
        <p><b>6. Code Navigation:</b> VS Code supports powerful navigation features such as "Go to Definition," "Find References," and "Go to Symbol," helping you quickly navigate through large codebases. </p>
        <p><b>7. Syntax Highlighting and Language Support:</b> VS Code offers syntax highlighting and language-specific features (like linting, formatting, etc.) for a wide variety of languages, including JavaScript, Python, C++, and many more. </p>
        <p><b>8. Live Share:</b> Live Share is a collaboration feature that allows developers to share their coding sessions in real time, making pair programming and collaborative debugging easy and seamless.</p>
        <p><b>9. Code Snippets:</b> Code snippets are reusable templates for common code structures. You can either use built-in snippets or create your own for more efficient coding.</p>
        <p><b>10. Emmet Support:</b> Emmet is a toolkit for web developers that allows you to write HTML and CSS faster by expanding simple abbreviations into full code structures.</p>
